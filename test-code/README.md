# LOC - Test code bases

This directory contains test "code-bases" for sample programs which will be used
as test-code on which the LOC generator scripts will run. The programs themselves
are basic "Hello World" programs, with file-/directory-structures laid out to
exercise different aspects of the generator script(s).
